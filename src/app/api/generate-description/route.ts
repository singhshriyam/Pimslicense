Write exactly 3 short, realistic incident descriptions that customers would report for this specific category and subcategory.

Requirements:
- Each description: 20-35 words maximum
- Write direct incident reports (what the customer is experiencing)
- NO meta-text like "Here are three" or "Option 1"
- Focus specifically on ${category} and ${subcategory} issues
- Sound like real customer complaints
- Be professional but direct

Separate each description with exactly: |||

Example format (for Water Pollution/Chemical Contamination):
Strange chemical smell coming from water taps. Water appears cloudy and has unusual taste requiring immediate investigation.|||Water supply contaminated with unknown substance. Strong odor and discoloration noticed when running taps.|||Chemical contamination suspected in water system. Residents reporting bad taste and smell from all water outlets.
